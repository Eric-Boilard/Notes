15-Character unique case sensitive form
18-character case safe

Salesforce Id can be seen in many places but in reports and formulas they are the 15 character version, everywhere else is 18.

Collection types:

Lists
Sets
Map (key value pair)
    Key object pair
    Key can be any type

You can debug apex but you cannot debug triggers so it helps to use apex replay debugger to replay the debug logs as if it is running.

Breakpoint: pause at a specific point to examine
Checkpoint: capture heap dumps and provide richer information for all local variables, static variables, and trigger context variables.

There will be questions on the exam for the collections and types.

Important to know difference between =, ==, ===

If you exceed limits an error will be thrown and the whole operation will be rolled back.
